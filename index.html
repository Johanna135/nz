    <h1>Neuseelandreise</h1>
    <h2>Doubtfull Sound</h2>
    <p><b>Doubtful Sound</b> / <b>Patea</b> is a fiord in Fiordland, in the far south west of New Zealand.</p>

    <p>It is located in the same region as the smaller but more famous and accessible Milford
        Sound / Piopiotahi. It took second place after Milford Sound as New Zealand's most famous
        tourism destination.</p>

    <p>At <strong><em>40 kilometres</em></strong> (25 mi) long, Doubtful Sound / Patea is the  second longest, and with a
        depth of up to <em>421 metres</em> (1,381 ft) the deepest of the South Island's fiords.In comparison with
        Milford Sound, it is more widespread, with the cliffs not as dramatically tall and near vertical. However, the
        U-shaped profile of the fiord is obvious, in particular on the two innermost of the main fiord's arms and the
        hanging side valleys along the main fiord.</p>
