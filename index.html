    <h2>Doubtfull Sound</h2>
    <p>Doubtful Sound / Patea is a fiord in Fiordland, in the far south west of New Zealand.</p>

    <p>It is located in the same region as the smaller but more famous and accessible Milford
        Sound / Piopiotahi. It took second place after Milford Sound as New Zealand's most famous
        tourism destination.</p>

        <p>At 40 kilometres (25 mi) long, Doubtful Sound / Patea is the second longest, and with a depth of up to 421 metres (1,381 ft) the deepest of the South Island's fiords.In comparison with Milford Sound, it is more widespread, with the cliffs not as dramatically tall and near vertical. However, the U-shaped profile of the fiord is obvious, in particular on the two innermost of the main fiord's arms and the hanging side valleys along the main fiord.</p>
